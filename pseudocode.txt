    IF user’s choice is “rock” and computer’s choice is “scissors”, or the user’s choice is “paper” and computer’s choice is “rock”, or the user’s choice is “scissors” and computer’s choice is “paper”, THEN:
        DISPLAY a message declaring the user’s win.

    ELSE:
        DISPLAY a message declaring the user’s lost.
        INCREMENT the computer’s wins count by 1.
